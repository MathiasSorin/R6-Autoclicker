How To Use It:

I would advise to put your game in borderless mode to config the App it will make it easier !

In the AFK_Farm_Dir folder you will find the application AFK_Farm_App double click on it.
(you can right click it and create a shortcut to put on your desktop if you wish, you can also change the icon of your shortcut, doka_icon.ico is provided in the folder)

Click on the ‘Config’ button on the App, it will give you the instructions.

Follow the exact instructions (when the App says don’t click, don’t click).

After that whenever you want to afk farm for the night close the game, open the program and press Start or !
You can also go in T-hunt directly and on the bomb site selection screen press start on the App, the App will detect that the game is already on and start farming right away !


#Start Button
If the game is closed it will boot the game, go to T-hunt and start farming.
If the game is open go to the bomb site select screen in the Tower T-hunt to make it work.
If the game crashes the script will detect it, reboot the game and will continue to farm.


#Stop Button
It will stop the process from the Start button.


#Config Button
It will erase the preferences you had set up and will ask you to configure it again.
Normally you should use this button only once, the first time you use the App.

#△ Button
Click it to put the App on the foreground it means that it will appear above all other windows, reclick it to deactivate this feature.
If during the configuration part your clicks don't register deactivate this feature.

#◯ Button
Click on it to set a automatic periodic restart, enter the amount in seconds 1h = 3600s, 2h = 7200s, 3h = 10800s, 4h = 14400s, 5h = 18000s.
This will every X time close the game, reboot the game, go back to farming. This feature acts as a failsafe in case sometimes the game brings you back to the menu.

Enjoy !
